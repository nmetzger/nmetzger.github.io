            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>There are many existing separate cloud storage services that allow collection of content, content storage, content creation and collaboration, but no service that does all these things in one unified space. Having to navigate between all these services to find a single saved item is time consuming, frustrating, and confusing.</p>

            <img src="../images/icons_solution.png">
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Brainspace aims to streamline and contain the ability to simply and easily collect content, create content, and collaborate in one centralized location instead of over many different applications. It allows users to save images, links, upload and access user files, create notes, and collaborate with others on those notes with a clean and simple interface.</p>

            <h3>User Surveys</h3>
            <p>I started my research with by surveying users to gain insight into how the current user base currently used cloud storage, what they liked about the services they used, and what were their pain points. Additionally, key behaviors in how users collected and used cloud saved content, basic demographics, and key use needs in cloud storage services was explored.

            <h6>Features/Tools</h6>
            <p>Through this survey, presented to eighteen individuals, a few trends were uncovered. Over all groups, the following features were consistently marked as high importance for a cloud storage app.</p>

            <p>There was a high indication that content collaboration/sharing,  multiplatform access, and syncing were important features (100%). Additionally, users stated that they preferred folders as their method of content organization (90%). </p>

            <p>The option to use a cloud storage application for free was overwhelmingly what users enjoyed the most about cloud storage. While 26% indicated that 50GB of data would be the minimum they would consider paying, 32% stated they were willing to pay $0.99/month for that storage. </p>
          </section>

          <section class="case-study-highlight">
            <p>When asked about how they used online storage, 79% stated they often have the need for creating/editing content online, 74% indicated they were not interested in sharing their saved content via social media, 79% indicated they preferred to share via email—this was an interesting discovery because the client thought social media sharing was something their users would want—and 40% indicated they wished current services had better organizational tools.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <p>To determine where Brainspace would sit in the current market place, I started with an analysis--exploring SWOT, pricing, user feedback, and audience positioning--of the current competitive landscape to reveal opportunities Brainbox could capture. Using the client’s requirements, and the most popular services as indicated by the user survey as a guide, I looked at the top three players for those features. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yTw5FaGfh3jCvn-VN3ceCw6SCKE6t-k65Map7UQPB18">View full competitive analysis.</a></p>

            <p>It was discovered that the competitors’ user base was slanted towards business teams and each tried to carve out their own unique niche in the market by focusing on a specific tight grouping of related features. The opportunity presented was for one centralized location with a simple, intuitive, and organized interface where everyday users could control all their content.</p>

            <p>Through the testing process several issues with the navigation flow were discovered and adjusted accordingly in future revisions. The top action items were:</p>

            <h3>Branding</h3> 
            <p>Looking at the current cloud storage service landscape, the branding for this product needed to differentiate itself while also eliciting the purpose of this new service. Many names were explored before eventually upon “Brainspace” to bring to mind a place to store all the content a user wants to remember. The feeling developed for this concept was spacious, simple, smart, thoughtful, fun, and open mind with the gap imagery in the logo mark. The brain inspired logo mark was also designed in a way to mimic cloud iconography, thus pulling in the idea of “the cloud” and all that entails. Additionally, the two halves of the brain invoke feelings of coming together and collaboration. The effectiveness of the brand’s goals were confirmed through user preference testing.</p>

            <p>Preference testing on my top three logo choices determined the final look. 80% of users selected the Brainspace name and logo.</p>

            <div class="user-quotes">
              <p>“I like that it suggest brain and cloud, which makes me think of smart and organized.”</p>

              <p>“It looks...thinky, brainy; there are two halves, and the 'space' in the name implies a shared experience, reinforcing the two halves imagery.”</p>

              <p>“Totally relate to brain space as I want good storage/organization so I have the brain space to be creative.”</p>
            </div>

            <p>With the logo finalized, the brand identity was built to complement and reinforce the feelings and functionality evoked through the logo. A style guide was developed with typography, colors, and UI elements to emphasize the core aspects of the Brainspace brand, namely fun, creative, intelligence, simplicity and collaboration.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The end result was a proof of concept that tied both the business requirements and user research derived usability requirements into a user friendly lightweight MVP. Through this process it became clear how cruital user testing is to the design process to make sure that the design works from a functionality and over all UX standpoint, to confirm the viability and feasibility of the client’s requirements within their target user base, and to also uncover opportunities that would be beneficial to the project. Iteration through user feedback loops were the most informative parts of this project.</p>

            <p>A significant challenge of this project was the ambiguity of the client’s requirements and the lack of market research to support the business requirements of the product. Without such research, there was some division in the user wants and desires discovered in my survey research and the client’s feature requirements which may result in less than optimal adoption in such a highly saturated competitive environment.</p>

            <p>With additional time and resources, I would build out additional test screens and conduct user testing to cover all of the product’s features including searching, filtering content, expanded collaboration, and note creating/editing. I would also build out and test the web version to discover any stumbling blocks to be solved with this responsive site.</p>
