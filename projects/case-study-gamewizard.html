            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>When getting together for game night, it can be difficult to select what tabletop games to
              play for those users with a large game library. Manually searching games for number of players,
              user’s interests, and game duration can be a time-consuming and frustrating task.</p>

            <div data-aos="flip-left"><img src="../images/icons_solution.png"></div>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Game Wizard aims to provide a quick and easy tool to select a compatible tabletop game for
              game night. It allows users to quickly build their game library and then search for games
              from their library based upon filters such as game type, number of players, and game duration,
              all with a clean and simple interface.</p>

            <p>For main functionality of Game Wizard—helping users pick a game—there are currently no
              solutions available. The competition in this related area are for game libraries and game
              stats. Since Game Wizard does have library storage functionality, the competitors for this
              feature were analyzed. <span class="page-link"><a href="../pdfs/game_wizard-pdfs/Game Wizard_Competitive Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">View full competitive analysis.</a></span></p>

              survey was conducted to explore what value users placed on a solution that met their needs. <span class="page-link"><a href="../pdfs/game_wizard-pdfs/Game Wizard_User Survey Analysis.pdf" target="_blank">See full user survey analysis.</a></span></p>

              were conceptualized to determine which layouts would best meet the needs of the users while remaining
              simple and easy to navigate.
              A quick round of paper prototype testing was used to identify any user flow problems before moving
              on to <span class="page-link"><a href="../pdfs/game_wizard-pdfs/Game Wizard-wireframes.pdf" target="_blank">wireframes</a></span>.
              Surprisingly, testers did not indicate there were any flow problems with the
              paper prototype.</p>

            <p>Tasks tested includeds, sign up, adding games to library, viewing library, viewing game details,
            searching for a game, searching for a friend, viewing user details, viewing friend list, running
            the game wizard, viewing and navigating the wizard results, and viewing and editing user settings.</p>

              <p class="isolated">Overall, the experience of the users was mostly favorable. Through the low-fi wireframe testing
                process several issues were discovered and adjusted accordingly in future revisions. The
                top action items were: two buttons on the Game Wizard (home) page were confusing and possibly
                not needed, it was unclear how the friend search results would look/function due to missing
                views, and it was unclear how a game would be removed from a user’s library.</p>

            <h3>Branding</h3>
            <p>The different options of branding, how it related to the application’s function and intent,
              were explored through sketching, preference testing, and moodboard research. Keeping the main
              functionality of the app and theme in mind, “Game Wizard” was chosen as it succinctly describes
              the purpose of the app while also allowing for some fun imagery to be developed with the name.
              The feeling developed for this concept was fun, playful, fantasy, and helpful for imagery in
              the logo mark. </p>

              <p class="isolated">Preference testing was used to refine the design. Taking note of testers reactions,
                I ended up simplifying the character design. This in turn carried over to the
                logo design as the hat tied into that design. Additionally, several rounds of preference testing were used
                to narrow down the logo branding marks. Below are the design iteration progressions and quotes from preference testers.</p>

              <p class="isolated">The action item of the two buttons on the Game Wizard (home) page were confusing
                and possibly not needed was thoroughly explored through preference testing and usability testing. The design of this
                screen went through quite a few iterations until the simple final design was discovered. </p>

                <p>As the product was converted to a high-fidelity prototype, preference testing was conducted to
                  further refine the design for the most effective user experiences. Usability testing was performed
                  to catch any issues and to gather more data on how user’s experienced the app. These top action
                  items users identified as needed further attention: remove search on wizard page, redesign the
                  progress bar, remove the redundant text “search to add friends”, and adjust placement of “remove
                  from library” link. </p>


                <p>Once all the top action items were addressed, the final design was
                applied to the high fidelity clickable prototype. Since this was a mobile first design,
                the mobile version was the final version created and tested with the option of a desktop
                version at a future stage of this project. </p>

                <p>Additionally, a <span class="page-link"><a href="https://nmetzger.github.io/game-wizard" target="_blank">simple informational website</a></span> was designed and built
                to provide additional information for users to explore and link to the various app stores.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <p>The end result was a completed design that tied user research derived usability requirements into a
              user friendly lightweight MVP ready for development. User research was valuable in determining if there
              was a significant need for the app and if the feature goals of the project matched user desires. Iteration
              through user feedback loops were the most informative parts of this project and caught issues before
              they were carried over to the final design.</p>

            <p>With additional time and resources, I would build out additional test screens and conduct
              user testing to cover all of the product’s features including additional searching,
              filtering content, and additional game detail display. Also, I would explore the possibility
              of rearranging the screens--and test this configuration--so signup is only necessary if a user
              would like to use the library function, that way a potential user can see the functionality
              without having to signup for an account. Future plans include building out and testing the Android
              and web versions.</p>
